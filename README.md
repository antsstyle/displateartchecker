# displateartchecker
An app to check for stolen art on Displate.

You need the following to run DisplateChecker:

- Java, if you don't have it already (https://java.com/en/download/)
- Google Chrome, if you don't have it already (https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/)
- Chromedriver (https://chromedriver.chromium.org/)

Copy any artwork files you want to test for Displate entries into the "Test Images" folder. 
They don't have to be high resolution; ordinary web preview size is fine.

Open searchterms.txt, and enter the terms you want to search Displate for. 
For example, if your artwork contains art of Tifa, Aerith and Mai Shiranui, put those into the text file (one entry per line).
